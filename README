=====

Rust bindings for the CUDA Driver API and NVRTC.

Three abstraction layers:

  sys     - raw FFI bindings (bindgen)
  result  - safe wrappers returning Result
  borrow  - RAII types with lifetime safety


Requirements
------------

  - NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support
  - CUDA Toolkit
  - Rust (edition 2021)


Building
--------

  $ cargo build

Set CUDA_PATH if CUDA is not in a standard location.
